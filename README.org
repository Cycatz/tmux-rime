* VT Rime server
** Installation 
*** Prerequisite
**** FreeBSD 

Install required packages: 
#+begin_src sh
pkg install git gcc gmake bash tmux zh-librime zh-fcitx-rime
#+end_src

You may need to create a symobol link called ~python~ to link to ~python3.X~
#+begin_src sh 
mkdir ~/bin
ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.8 ~/bin/python
#+end_src


Create a empty directory ~/usr/share/rime-data~ (I know it's a bad practice in FreeBSD), and put all your rime configs into ~/.config/tmux_rime/rime/~.

You may also copy the default configs (under ~/usr/local/share/rime-data~):
#+begin_src 
sudo touch /usr/share/rime-data
mkdir -p ~/.config/tmux_rime
cp -r /usr/local/share/rime-data ~/.config/tmux_rime/rime
#+end_src

*** Building

Clone the repo and build it:  
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/Cycatz/tmux-rime.git rime-server
cd ./rime-server
git checkout vt-rime 
./build.sh
#+end_src

** Usage 
First, install the custom kernel https://github.com/Cycatz/freebsd-src and switch the branch to ~releng/13.0~. However, I'm not going to introduce how to configure the custom kernel here.

After you finish configuring the kernel, you'll need to start another console/terminal on your computer with the newly-built kernel to run the rime IME server. 
#+begin_src sh
./rime-server/rime-server/rime-server.py
#+end_src

Now you can press the right ctrl key to toggle the IME mode and type in Chinese in ~vt~!
